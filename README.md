Supply Chain Analysis: Dataset
To analyze a companyâ€™s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.

I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup. You can download the dataset from here(https://tinyurl.com/38rkx2xv)

In the section below, I will take you through the task of Supply Chain Analysis using the Python programming language.
